  /**
   * Run a Codebuff agent with the specified options.
   *
   * @param agent - The agent to run. Use 'base' for the default agent, or specify a custom agent ID if you made your own agent config.
   * @param prompt - The user prompt describing what you want the agent to do.
   * @param params - (Optional) Additional parameters for the agent. Most agents don't use this, but some custom agents can take a JSON object as input in addition to the user prompt string.
   * @param handleEvent - (Optional) Callback function that receives every event during execution (assistant messages, tool calls, etc.). This allows you to stream the agent's progress in real-time. We will likely add a token-by-token streaming callback in the future.
   * @param previousRun - (Optional) JSON state returned from a previous run() call. Use this to continue a conversation or session with the agent, maintaining context from previous interactions.
   * @param projectFiles - (Optional) All the files in your project as a plain JavaScript object. Keys should be the full path from your current directory to each file, and values should be the string contents of the file. Example: { "src/index.ts": "console.log('hi')" }. This helps Codebuff pick good source files for context.
   * @param knowledgeFiles - (Optional) Knowledge files to inject into every run() call. Uses the same schema as projectFiles - keys are file paths and values are file contents. These files are added directly to the agent's context.
   * @param agentDefinitions - (Optional) Array of custom agent definitions. Each object should satisfy the AgentDefinition type. You can input the agent's id field into the agent parameter to run that agent.
   * @param customToolDefinitions - (Optional) Array of custom tool definitions that extend the agent's capabilities. Each tool definition includes a name, Zod schema for input validation, and a handler function. These tools can be called by the agent during execution.
   * @param maxAgentSteps - (Optional) Maximum number of steps the agent can take before stopping. Use this as a safety measure in case your agent starts going off the rails. A reasonable number is around 20.
   *
   * @returns A Promise that resolves to a RunState JSON object which you can pass to a subsequent run() call to continue the run. Use result.output to get the agent's output.
