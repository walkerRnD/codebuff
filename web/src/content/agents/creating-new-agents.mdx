# Creating New Agents

Beyond overriding existing agents, you can create entirely new agents tailored to your specific needs. Codebuff supports two types of custom agents:

- **LLM-based Agents** - Traditional AI agents using prompts and language models
- **Programmatic Agents** - Custom agents using JavaScript/TypeScript code

## LLM-Based Agents

LLM-based agents are the most common type. They use language models to process requests and generate responses.

### Basic Structure

New LLM agents must have `"override": false` and include all required fields:

```json
{
  "id": "my-custom-agent",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "override": false,

  "name": "My Custom Agent",
  "description": "A specialized agent for my workflow",
  "model": "anthropic/claude-4-sonnet-20250522",
  "outputMode": "last_message",
  "includeMessageHistory": true,
  "toolNames": ["read_files", "write_file", "end_turn"],
  "stopSequences": ["</end_turn>"],
  "spawnableAgents": ["researcher"],
  "promptSchema": {
    "prompt": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "What documentation to create or update"
    }
  },

  "systemPrompt": {
    "path": "./doc-writer-system.md"
  },
  "userInputPrompt": "Create comprehensive documentation based on the user's request. Research existing code and patterns first.",
  "agentStepPrompt": "Continue working on the documentation. Use end_turn when complete."
}
```

# Documentation Writer Agent

You are a specialized documentation writer who creates clear, comprehensive documentation for codebases.

## Your Role

- Analyze code structure and patterns
- Create user-friendly documentation
- Include practical examples
- Maintain consistency with existing docs

## Guidelines

- Start by researching the codebase
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Structure content logically
- Test examples for accuracy
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand both overriding existing agents and creating new ones:

1. **Start Small** - Begin with simple overrides before creating new agents
2. **Experiment** - Try different tool combinations and prompt styles
3. **Share** - Consider sharing useful agents with your team
4. **Iterate** - Continuously improve your agents based on usage

```
