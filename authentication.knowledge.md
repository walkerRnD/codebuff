# Authentication Flow for Manicode

## Overview

Manicode implements a secure authentication flow that involves the npm-app (CLI), backend, and web application. This document outlines the key steps and security measures in place.

## Authentication Process

1. CLI Initiation:

   - The npm-app sends a `fingerprintId` to the backend via WebSocket on a `login` message type.

2. One-Time Auth Code:

   - Backend creates a one-time auth code consisting of:
     a. `fingerprintId` (to link the current session with user credentials)
     b. Timestamp (5 minutes in the future, for link expiration)
     c. Hash of the above + a secret value (for request verification)
   - Backend appends this auth code to the login URL: `${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/login?auth_code=<token-goes-here>`

3. User Login:

   - npm-app receives the link, displays it to the user, and automatically opens the browser.
   - User visits the link and goes through the OAuth flow.
   - The `redirect_uri` should include the auth code as a query parameter.
   - If needed, store the auth code in local storage to persist through OAuth flows.

4. Credential Verification:

   - After OAuth, the browser calls the `app/onboard` server component with the auth code and user credentials.
   - The server component verifies the hash using received values and stores the `fingerprintId` + hash in a new session row in the database.

5. Session Establishment:
   - npm-app sends a WebSocket message every few seconds to the backend to check for a session with the same `fingerprintId` and hash.
   - If a matching session is found, the backend sends the user's credentials to the CLI via WebSockets.
   - npm-app saves the credentials locally.

## Security Considerations

- The one-time auth code includes a hash with a secret value, ensuring the request comes from a trusted source.
- The auth code has a short expiration time (5 minutes) to limit the window of potential misuse.
- The `fingerprintId` is used to link the CLI session with the web login, preventing session hijacking.
- User credentials are never stored or transmitted in plain text.

## Integration with Billing

- Upon successful authentication, the user's billing status and quota are retrieved from the database.
- The authenticated user's quota and usage limits are applied to their session.
- Subscription status affects the user's access to premium features and higher usage limits.

## Best Practices

1. Always use secure WebSocket connections (WSS) in production environments.
2. Regularly rotate secret keys used for hash generation.
3. Implement rate limiting on authentication attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
4. Use HTTPS for all web communications, especially during the OAuth flow.
5. Regularly audit and update the authentication flow to address new security concerns.

## Future Considerations

1. Implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
2. Consider using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication.
3. Develop a system for handling password resets and account recovery.
4. Implement a more robust session management system with the ability to revoke sessions.
