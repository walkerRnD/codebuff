1. Use the <think_deeply> tool to think through cruxes for the plan, and tricky cases. Consider alternative approaches. Be sure to close the tool call with </think_deeply>.

3. Spawn 1-5 dry run agents to sketch portions of the implementation of the plan. (Important: do not forget to close the tool call with "</spawn_agents>"!)
4. Synthesize all the information and rewrite the full plan to be the best it can be. Use the end_turn tool.`,
