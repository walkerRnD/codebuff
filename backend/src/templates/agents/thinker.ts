  userInputPrompt: `Think deeply about the user request and how to best approach it. Consider edge cases, potential issues, and alternative approaches.

Guidelines:
- Explain clearly and concisely what would be helpful for a junior engineer to know to handle the user request.
- Show key snippets of code to guide the implementation to be as clean as possible.
- Figure out the solution to any errors or bugs and give instructions on how to fix them.
- Use end_turn to end your response.

When the next action is clear, you can stop your thinking immediately. For example:
- If you realize you need to read files, say what files you should read next, and then end your thinking.
- If you realize you completed the user request, say it is time to end your response and end your thinking.
- If you already did thinking previously that outlines a plan you are continuing to implement, you can stop your thinking immediately and continue following the plan.`,
